# eCommerce-Project-Data-Science
**Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset**

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce dataset consisting of Customers, Products, and Transactions. It focuses on three key tasks:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Building a Lookalike Model
3. Performing Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## Files in the Repository
- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for performing EDA.
- `Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for clustering and customer segmentation.
- `Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for building the lookalike model.
- `EDA.pdf`: PDF report summarizing EDA insights.
- `Clustering.pdf`: PDF report summarizing customer segmentation results.
- `Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing lookalike recommendations for the first 20 customers.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the following notebooks:
   - `EDA.ipynb`: Perform exploratory data analysis.
   - `Clustering.ipynb`: Execute customer segmentation using clustering.
   - `Lookalike_Model.ipynb`: Generate lookalike recommendations.

## Outputs
- `EDA.pdf`: Business insights derived from EDA.
- `Clustering.pdf`: Summary of clustering results.
- `Lookalike.csv`: Lookalike recommendations for the first 20 customers.

## Key Libraries
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computations
- matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
- scikit-learn: Machine learning models and clustering
- notebook & jupyterlab: Interactive environment
